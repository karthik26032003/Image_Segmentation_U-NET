Image Segmentation Using U-NET.
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementation of Image Segmentation using the U-NET architecture. U-NET is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for precise segmentation tasks, particularly within biomedical image processing but also adaptable to various fields in image segmentation.
Overview
The ImageSegmentation_U-NET.ipynb notebook covers the entire workflow for training a U-NET model on a given dataset for image segmentation tasks. This implementation demonstrates U-NETâ€™s effectiveness by providing detailed segmentation maps for the input images, making it suitable for applications requiring object boundary precision.

Architecture
The U-NET model, a type of Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), is composed of two main paths:

Contracting Path (Encoder): Captures the context in the image using a sequence of convolutions and max-pooling layers to downsample the input image.
Expanding Path (Decoder): Reconstructs the segmentation map from the captured context through upsampling and convolutions, with skip connections from the encoder for feature reuse.
Prerequisites
This notebook is written in Python and requires the following packages:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (based on the chosen framework in the notebook)
Keras (if using TensorFlow backend)
OpenCV (for image preprocessing and visualization)
NumPy, Matplotlib, and other essential Python libraries
Usage
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess your dataset of images and corresponding masks. Update paths to the dataset in the notebook as necessary.

Training the Model: Execute the cells in the notebook to train the U-NET model. Training parameters such as batch size, epochs, and learning rate can be configured as per your dataset size and GPU availability.

Evaluation: Use the model to predict segmentation masks on new data and visualize the outputs.

Customization: Experiment with the architecture and hyperparameters to fine-tune the model for better segmentation performance.

Results
The model's performance will be presented through metrics such as:

Dice Coefficient
Intersection over Union (IoU)
Visualization of the segmentation results can be compared to the ground truth masks to evaluate accuracy.
